nFIRST CRY WEBSITE IMPROVEMENT AND ADVICES
While going through the website i did saw the classified columns of different products offering but at the same time i can see 
the whole website is full of clothing of different styles and ethinicinty instead of dispaling other eye catchy products that might 
come in our view first like showng diapers in one, toys in others  instead showing just clothes all over the website that kind of gives a very wrong impression
or i should say misinterpretetion to those potential customers who go by eyes not by reading website stuffs.
MY FIRST AND FOREMOST ADVICE IS TO SOMEHOW ADD SOME MORE CUSTOMIZATIONS TO USERS FIRSTLY IN ORDER TO SPECIFY THE KIND OF REQUIREMENT YOU HAVE
IT SHOULD FIRST SCAN THE DATA AND ASK THE USER TO ENTER THE AGE OF CHILD AND SEX IN NECESSARY (SINCE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TILL THE AGE OF 2 YEARS)
BUT THIS WAY COMPANY WILL HAVE A DATABASE ABOUT HOW A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER HAS BEEN MAKING SEARCH QUERIES. IT MIGHT EASE THE STUFF.

I WENT THROUGH THE WEBSITE AS WELL I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE WEBSITE FIRSTCRY.COM AND
I MYSELF HAD A BIT OF EXPERIENCE MYSELF I BELIEVE FIRSTCRY SHOULD INTRODUCE SYSTEMATIC
TRACKING AND EXACT STATUS INSTEAD OF DISPATCH AND RECIEVED STATUS . THE TIME IN BETWEEN
IS USUALLY NOT MENTIONED . AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS INSTANCES WHEN THE PARCEL HAS BEEN
RECIEVED AFTER THE MENTIONED DATE OF COMMITMENT.THE QUERY AND CUSTOMER CARE IS BETWEEN 9 AM TO 8PM
I BELIEVE THERE CAN BE A A LITTLE BIT OF MARGIN ON THIS SIDE STRETCHING IT TO ALMOST 9 IN NIGHT .
THEY HAVE  KIND OF CUMBERSOME PROCESS WHILE MAKING A REFUND THAT IS FIRSTLY INTO THE FIRST CRY ACCOUNT 
AND LATER OR PARTIAL REFUND INTO INTENDED BANK ACCOUNT . THIS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM SINCE THERE IS NOT INSTANEOUS
STATUS RECORD FOR THE SAME.
MOST OF THE E COMMERCE SITE I WENT THROUGH I HAVE SEEN A AUTOMATED QUERY AND HELPLINE POPUP BOX AND THIS KIND OF
FUNCTIONALITY IS IMPORTANT FOR A SITE LIKE FIRST CRY SINCE I BELIEVE BUYING STUFFS FOR CHILDREN IS SOMEWHAT MORE 
OF A ON FIELD JOB WHERE YOU DIRECTLY MAKE THE CHILD TRY IT SOMEHOW AND THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION SO THERE MUST BE EXECUTIVES
WHO SHOULD BE THERE TO HELP YOU OUT 
LOT OF AD POP UPS  I SAW ON THE WEBSITE THAT  MIGHT BE A PROBLEM FOR A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER.
ONE THING THAT I CAN ADD ON FROM MY OWN SIDE THAT THEIR DELIEVERY DATE KEEPS ON EXTENDING MOST OF TIMES. SINCE I HAD LOT OF 
DIAPERS ORDERED FROM THIS WEBSITE AND TRUST ME THEY DO EXTEND DATES MOST OF TIMES. BUT WHAT WE CAN ADD A PRESENT PACKAGE LOCATION 
STATUS MONITORING FACILITY TO ATLEAST MAKE IT MORE PRESENTABLE TO POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.
